      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello! I am currently a student at University of Minnesota Coding Bootcamps. I also do comercial, and residential lawn mowing for Murtha Lawn Care LLC.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I grew up about forty minutes east of the twin cities, in the small town of Hammond, WI.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Outside of work and the classrom I enjoy many different activities such as; hunting, fishing, watching sports, and playing video games.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job, ever since I was young, was to be a Professional Bass Fisherman.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently still live in Hammond, WI.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>The process of starting my developer career is not a short one. I came out of high school thinking that I was going to play college football for the University of Wisconsin-River Falls. I quickly realized that was not the route I wanted. I went on to change my major from Environmental Engineering, to Physical Therapy. I tansferred schools, and enrolled at Chippewa Valley Technical College. After leaving CVTC I was in search of a new career path, and my older brother came to me with the idea of becoming a Software Engineer like him. I never thought of the tech field as being where I would land, however I really enjoy technology and video games so it didn't seem out of reach. After researching more about web developpment, and learning to use some software on my own. I realized that I actually really enjoyed working with the different software programs!</p>
